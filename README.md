Explorations in Simulated Nation Building

The core idea here is to model the development of a nation based upon a given operational architecture as laid down in a 
"constitution" (and perhaps occasional minor tweaks, via "constitutional amendments"). We initialize the nascent nation,
and then following it through hundreds of yearsof history under assumptions of population growth, major events 
(e.g., wars, some of which hopefully would emerge from the model itself, esp. internal wars such as civil wars) and so on. 
We can experiment with different initial architectures, and perhaps different external influences.

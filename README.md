Explorations in Simulated Nation Building

The core idea is to model the development of a nation based upon a given operational architecture as laid down in a 
"constitution" (and perhaps occasional minor tweaks via "constitutional amendments"). We initialize the nascent nation,
and then follow it through hundreds of years of history under assumptions of population growth, major events 
(e.g., wars, some of which hopefully would emerge from the model itself, esp. internal wars such as civil wars) and so on. 
We can experiment with different initial architectures, and perhaps different external influences.
